## Note

This repository is for my PhD application, where I was asked to upload my CV and motivation letter in a single file and send the link to that PDF.

The required file is the `academic_cv_reference_motivation_letter.pdf`.

It was inconvenient to use OneDrive and Google Drive because the link was not acceptable in the application form. Therefore, I had to come up with this solution.

I would like to thank the selection committee for their understanding.
